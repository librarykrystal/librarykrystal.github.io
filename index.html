    <p>A creative and inquisitive individual with a love for written language, I enjoy problem-solving but also have the easy-going patience for tasks requiring repetition. Years of working in libraries both academic and public fed my passions for information accuracy, literature, and connecting people with things that inspire them. More recent experiences as a professionally trained picture framer and floral designer taught me new skills through the tackling of varied projects, ingraining valuable communication habits all the while. Looking forward, I hope to settle into a career that fits, challenges, and fulfills.</p>
